		<p>Date of Last Revision: June 23, 2008</p>
		<p>Our Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use. By accessing or using Flowgram, you agree to abide by it. Flowgram’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and to help you make informed decisions when using Flowgram, located at www.flowgram.com and its directly associated domains (collectively, "Flowgram" or the "Website"). If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at privacy@flowgram.com. </p>
		<p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></p>
		<p>When you visit Flowgram, you provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information you knowingly choose to disclose to us; and (2) Website use information that we collect as you use Flowgram.</p>
				<p>If you choose to register with Flowgram (which is not required), you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.</p>
				<p>When you enter Flowgram, we collect your browser type and IP address. We also store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Flowgram. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
		<p>When you use Flowgram, you may set up your personal profile to facilitate your transmittal or receipt of information through various channels. We collect this profile information so that we can provide you the Flowgram service. In most cases, we retain this information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
				<p>You post User Content (as defined in the Flowgram Terms of Use) on Flowgram at your own risk. Even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Flowgram users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
				<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about Flowgram, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to visit Flowgram. Flowgram stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at remove@flowgram.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
				<p>By using Flowgram, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
				<p><strong>Children</strong> </p>
				<p>If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at remove@flowgram.com.</p>
				<p>Flowgram strongly urges parents to talk to their children (of any age) about the dangers they may encounter online, and to make sure their children are using Flowgram in a safe manner. Children should be told to report any inappropriate content to their parents, and to Flowgram at abuse@flowgram.com. Despite Flowgram's safety and privacy controls, Flowgram cannot guarantee that its Website will be entirely free of illegal, offensive, pornographic or otherwise inappropriate material, or that its users will not encounter inappropriate or illegal conduct from other users.</p>
		<p>More information regarding Internet safety for children can be found on the following sites:</p>
		<ul><li>OnguardOnline.gov</li>
				<li>WiredSafety.org</li>
				<li>CommonSenseInMedia.org</li>
				<li>Ncmec.org</li>
				<li>TRUSTe.org</li>
				<li>ConnectSafely.org</li>
				<li>NetSmartz.org</li>
				<li>WebWiseKids.org</li></ul>
		<p><strong>Use of Information Obtained by Flowgram</strong></p>
				<p>When you register with Flowgram (which is not required), you create your own profile. Profile information is used by Flowgram primarily to be presented back to when you access Flowgram. We may occasionally use your name and email address to notify you regarding new services offered by Flowgram that we think you may find useful. Generally, you may opt out of such emails, though Flowgram reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of voluntary email notifications. Flowgram may also send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of Flowgram. </p>
				<p>Flowgram may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as personalizing advertisements and promotions. We believe this benefits you by making any advertisements more relevant and interesting to you. </p>
				<p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong></p>
				<p>We will not provide contact information to third party marketers without your express permission, and we have no plans ever to do so. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is (1) reasonably necessary to offer Flowgram services; (2) legally required; or (3) permitted by you. </p>
				<p>For example:</p>
				<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the Flowgram services. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the Flowgram service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Flowgram, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). Our service providers may have access to your personal information for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we use third parties to process any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Flowgram-specified purposes.</p>
				<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Flowgram service or using the Flowgram name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
				<p>We let you choose whether to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers.</p>
				<p>Like many other websites that interact with third party sites, we may receive some information from those sites even if you are logged out from Flowgram, or that pertains to non-Flowgram users, in conjunction with the technical operation of our system. When we receive information on users that are not logged in, or on non-Flowgram users, we do not attempt to associate it with individual Flowgram accounts and will discard it.</p>
				<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Flowgram business, or individual business units owned by Flowgram, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the Flowgram service can continue operations. Your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p>When you use Flowgram, certain information you make available on Flowgram may be shared with other users in accordance with the Terms of Use (for example, messages directed to another user, or posts on a blog or user forum maintained by Flowgram). All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that personal information you disclose on Flowgram may become publicly available.</p>
				<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
				<p>Flowgram may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other Websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each Website that collects personally identifiable information. Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Flowgram.</p>
				<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
				<p>Our Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Flowgram and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers. Advertisements that appear on Flowgram are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to our users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time it sends you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of its ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, advertising networks may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and to determine which advertisements are clicked. Flowgram does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Flowgram unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
				<p><strong>Changing or Removing Information</strong></p>
				<p>Registered Flowgram users (registration is not required) may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Flowgram account may do so by emailing closeaccount@flowgram.com. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time. When you share information with other users on Flowgram, however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another Flowgram user, either directly or through a blog or a user forum), you generally cannot remove such communications.</p>
				<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
				<p>Flowgram takes appropriate precautions to protect the privacy of our users’ information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecureSocketsLayer). Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, you should not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of Flowgram, please contact us at privacy@flowgram.com.</p>
				<p><strong>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</strong></p>
				<p>Your use of Flowgram, and any disputes arising from it, are subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications in our Privacy Policy will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy’s new effective date. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
				<p><strong>Contacting the Website</strong></p>
				<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@flowgram.com. You may also contact us by mail at 650 Townsend Street, Suite 315, San Francisco, CA 94103.</p>
