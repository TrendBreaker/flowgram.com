				<h3>Posting Material to the Site</h3>
				<p><strong>How can I tell if content I upload or use in a flowgram is copyrighted?</strong><br/>Before uploading content to the Flowgram website (to a blog or user forum maintained by us, for example), or including any content in a flowgram, please be certain that you own the copyright to the content or have the permission of the copyright owner to use it. If all the content is created solely by you and does not contain material created by any other party ("Third Party Content"), or if the copyright holder has authorized you to use Third Party Content, you may upload the content to our website (as long as it complies with our Terms of Use), or use it in a flowgram you create (subject to any restrictions that may have been imposed by the Third Party Content owner). We cannot provide you with legal advice about whether you own the copyright to any content. Consult an attorney to be certain of your rights. </p>
				<p><strong>What can I do if I don't own the copyright to the content I uploaded or used in a flowgram, or I don't have the permission of the copyright owner to use it?</strong><br/>You should remove immediately any infringing content you have uploaded to our website or have used in a flowgram. Although we are not required to do so, it is our present practice to invite owners of Third Party Content who believe their intellectual property rights have been violated by a Flowgram user to notify us. We will contact the person alleged to be infringing the rights of the Third Party Content owner and request that the infringing use cease. We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of the intellectual property rights of Flowgram or Third Party Content owners.</p>
				<p><strong>Do I own the copyright to content that I filmed on my own camcorder or phone from the television, live concert, or sporting event?</strong><br/>Just because you recorded the content onto your own recording device such as a phone or camcorder does not necessarily mean that you own the copyright to that material or that you are authorized to use it. Disclaiming ownership of that content cannot protect you from infringing on the true owner's copyright. If you have any question as to whether you are legally authorized to use or upload any content, consult an attorney before uploading it to the Flowgram website or in a flowgram.</p>
				<p><strong>What does "public domain" mean?</strong><br/>Content is released into the "public domain" when the term of the copyright on that content expires. Once content is in the public domain, it can be used freely by the public. </p>
				<p><strong>Do I retain the copyright and other legal rights to material I upload to Flowgram?</strong><br/>Yes, except that a special rule applies to material you upload to any blog maintained by Flowgram for its users (see next Question). You retain the copyright to your content. When you upload your content you grant us a license to use and display your content. For more information please visit our Terms of Use, which contains a link to our Copyright Policy and other important information about your privileges and responsibilities as a Flowgram user.</p>
				<p><strong>Do I retain the copyright and other legal rights to material I upload to a Flowgram blog?</strong><br/>Unless you specify otherwise, any and all works of authorship copyrightable by you and posted by you on any Flowgram blog or user forum are submitted under the terms of an Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons Public License. Under this license, you permit anyone to copy, distribute, display and perform your content, royalty-free, on the condition that they credit your authorship each time they do so. You also permit others to distribute derivative works of your content, but only if they do so under the same Attribution-ShareAlike license that governs your original content. Please read the full text of the Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons Public License and see "Blog and User Forum Content" in our Terms of Use for more details.</p>
				<h3>Reports of Copyright Infringement</h3>
				<p><strong>Why was my content removed?</strong><br/>Your content was removed because we determined that it violates the Flowgram Terms of Use and/or the code of conduct to which you agreed when you accessed or used the Flowgram website. The Flowgram Terms of Use includes our content, copyright and privacy policies. Please reread our Terms of Use and our code of conduct and be certain that all of your remaining content on the Flowgram website complies with these rules. If you believe your content was incorrectly reported as copyright infringing, please visit our Copyright Policy to find out how to submit a copyright Counter Notification and request that we restore your content.</p>
				<p><strong>What if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?</strong><br/>In accordance with our Copyright Policy and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we will notify you if your content has been removed from the Flowgram website because another party claims your content is copyright infringing. If you believe your content was mistakenly or incorrectly reported as copyright infringing, please visit our Copyright Policy to find out how to submit a copyright Counter Notification and request that we restore your content.</p>
				<p><strong>How does Flowgram prevent users from uploading material that is copyright infringing?</strong><br/>Our Terms of Use and code of conduct prohibit users from transmitting to the Flowgram website any materials that violate another party's intellectual property rights. We encourage our users to report instances of copyright infringement using the procedures outlined in our Copyright Policy, and we terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.</p>
				<p><strong>How do I report copyright infringement?</strong><br/>If you believe that content on the Flowgram website violates another party's copyright, you should contact the copyright owner directly. However, if you believe that your own copyrighted work is accessible on the Flowgram website, or has been used to create a flowgram, in violation of your copyright, please visit our Copyright Policy to find out how to submit a notification of alleged copyright infringement.</p>
				<p><strong>Is Flowgram responsible for violations of the intellectual property rights of other persons by Flowgram users?</strong><br/>No. Although it is our present practice to invite Third Party Content owners to submit a Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement, and to respond to any proper Notification as described below, we do so as a courtesy and do not, by doing so, assume any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the use or misuse by any person of Third Party Content. We reserve the right at any time, without notice to any person, to cease our practice of inviting, and responding to, a Notification of Alleged Copyright Infringement from any Third Party Content owner.</p>
