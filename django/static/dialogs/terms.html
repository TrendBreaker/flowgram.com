<h3>Flowgram | Terms of Service</h3>
<p>Date of Last Revision: June 23, 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to Flowgram. </strong></p>
<p>The Flowgram Inc. website (www.flowgram.com) (the "Site"), service (the "Service") and network are operated by Flowgram Inc. ("us", "we" or "the Company"). In addition to the services we make available to users on the Site, the term "Service" includes software tools provided by the Company for use apart from the Site – for example, applications, bookmarklets and applications used to install them, Flash widgets and other software, all of which enable users to create, edit, annotate and share "flowgrams" that may include content from third-party websites and/or other content sources ("Third Party Content"). The Site, the Service and the Flowgram network are sometimes referred to collectively as "Flowgram" in these Terms of Use. By accessing or using Flowgram, you (the "User") acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms of Use ("Terms of Use" or "Agreement").</p>
<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> By its nature, Flowgram involves the collection, arrangement, editing and annotation of Third Party Content. All Third Party Content will be owned by third parties unaffiliated with Flowgram Inc., who will have sole control over the use, if any, that may be made of such Third Party Content by a User. Each User is solely responsible for ensuring that he or she has the right to use all Third Party Content included in any "flowgram" or other materials created by the User with Flowgram. See especially the section of these Terms of Use entitled "Third Party Content," and our Copyright Policy.</em></p>
<p>We have the right to change these Terms of Use at any time without notice. We will post any changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date on which these terms were last revised. Your continued use of Flowgram after any changes will constitute your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access Flowgram. It is your responsibility to check the Site regularly to determine whether changes have been made.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. THEY INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, AND A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS HOW DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility to Use Flowgram</strong></p>
<p>Use of Flowgram is void where prohibited. Flowgram is intended only for users who are at least 13 years of age, or who are using Flowgram under the supervision of a parent or guardian. By using the Service or the Site, you represent that you are at least 13 and agree to these Terms of Use.</p>
<p><strong>Trademarks</strong></p>
<p>"Flowgram" and other Company graphics, logos, designs, page headers, button icons, scripts and service names are registered trademarks, trademarks or trade dress of the Company in the U.S. and/or other countries. The Company’s trademarks and trade dress may not be used, including as part of trademarks and/or as part of domain names, in connection with any product or service in any manner that is likely to cause confusion, and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without the Company’s prior written permission.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary Rights in Site Content; Limited License</strong></p>
<p>All content on the Site, including designs, text, graphics, pictures, video, information, applications, software, music, sound and other files, and their selection and arrangement (the "Site Content"), are and will remain the property of the Company, its users or its licensors, with all rights reserved. No Site Content may be modified, copied, framed, downloaded, displayed, transmitted, or sold without the Company’s written permission, though this does not apply to your own User Content (as defined below) that you legally post on the Site. You are granted a limited license to access and use Flowgram and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Site Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that you keep all copyright or other proprietary notices intact. Except for your own User Content or as otherwise specifically provided in these Terms of Use, you may not upload or republish Site Content on any Internet, Intranet or Extranet site or incorporate the information in any other database or compilation, and any other use of the Site Content is strictly prohibited. Your license does not include use of any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods. Any use of Flowgram other than as specifically authorized herein, without the written permission of the Company, is strictly prohibited and will terminate your license. Such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws, including copyright and trademark laws, and applicable communications regulations and statutes. This license is revocable at any time without notice and with or without cause.</p>
<p><strong>User Content Posted on the Site</strong></p>
<p>When you post content to the Site that you own ("User Content"), you authorize us to make such copies thereof as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the posting and storage of the User Content on the Site. By posting User Content to any part of the Site, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, on or in connection with the Site or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing. You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to remove your User Content, the license granted to us above will automatically expire, except that you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content. Flowgram does not assert any ownership over your User Content; rather, as between us and you, subject to the rights granted to us in these Terms, you retain full ownership of all of your User Content and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with your User Content.</p>
<p><em>Special rules apply to User Content uploaded to a blog or user forum maintained by us – see "Blog and User Forum Content" below.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blog and User Forum Content</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms of Use, unless you specify otherwise, any and all works of authorship copyrightable by you and posted by you to any blog or user forum maintained by Flowgram (either for users generally, for groups of users, or for particular users, including you) (collectively, "Blog Content") are submitted under the terms of an Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons Public License. Under this license, you permit anyone to copy, distribute, display and perform your Blog Content, royalty-free, on the condition that they credit your authorship each time they do so. You also permit others to distribute derivative works of your Blog Content, but only if they do so under the same Attribution-ShareAlike license that governs your original Blog Content. Please read the full text of the Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons Public License.</p>
<p>Among other things, this license permits RSS aggregators to copy, distribute, display and perform any Blog Content on a blog that is syndicated using RSS. All Blog Content is syndicated for RSS aggregation unless you change your settings to indicate otherwise. If you prefer to offer your Content on more restrictive terms, label your submission with a full copyright notice, i.e., your name, the word "copyright" or symbol "©" and the year of first publication.</p>
<p>Flowgram has no obligation to establish or maintain any blog or user forum, and if it does so, it may modify, terminate, or restrict access to any blog or user forum at any time for any reason or no reason, without notice.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Content</strong></p>
<p>Flowgram enables a User to create a "flowgram," which is a collection of content, or links to content, obtained by a User from one or more third-party Websites and/or other electronic sources (collectively, "Third Party Content"), and to edit, annotate and share Third Party Content included in a flowgram. Flowgram does not claim a copyright in any Third Party Content that may be included in a flowgram, and it has no agreement, arrangement or understanding with any other person to permit Flowgram users to make use of any Third Party Content in a flowgram or for any other purpose. The content included in a User’s flowgram may be subject to terms of use or a similar agreement established by the owner of the Third Party Content included in the flowgram. Each User is solely responsible for determining the extent, if any, to which the User is permitted to use any Third Party Content included in a flowgram created by the User. Special attention should be paid to any restrictions on use imposed by the owner of Third Party Content, including, by way of example only, restrictions on the use of Third Party Content for any commercial purpose, the establishment of hyperlinks to any Third Party Content, the inclusion of any Third Party Content in any collection of content from multiple Websites or other sources, the transmittal of Third Party Content to another person, the editing of Third Party Content or the annotation of any Third Party Content. </p>
<p>In addition to restrictions that may be imposed on the use of Third Party Content as described in the preceding paragraph, the Site contains (or you may be sent through the Site or the Service) links to other web sites ("Third Party Sites") as well as articles, photographs, text, graphics, pictures, designs, music, sound, video, information, applications, software and other content or items belonging to or originating from third parties (the "Third Party Applications, Software or Content"). Such Third Party Sites and Third Party Applications, Software or Content are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Third Party Sites accessed through the Site or any Third Party Applications, Software or Content posted on, available through or installed from the Site, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices or other policies of or contained in the Third Party Sites or the Third Party Applications, Software or Content. Inclusion of, linking to or permitting the use or installation of any Third Party Site or any Third Party Applications, Software or Content does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by us. If you decide to leave the Site and access the Third Party Sites or to use or install any Third Party Applications, Software or Content, you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that our terms and policies no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any site to which you navigate from the Site or relating to any applications you use or install from the site.</p>
