Background:
-----------
This is the source code to a startup that lived from 2007 to 2009. Flowgram.com 
was my first full-time employer, and I'm happy to be able to keep alive some
part of what we did.

We had an innovative product. In short, "Flowgram is a way to share Web pages, 
photos, and videos in a browser-based player that acts like an interactive 
screencast."

Watch this YouTube video for details: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8vmNRnzDSg

Ultimately, we weren't able to get enough traction. I got the source code from
another employee, and permission to post it from the founder.

I hope more "before their time" startups can find a way to release their code!


Code:
-----
There are two top-level folders corresponding to two services that need to run. 
Content added to a Flowgram is represented by a screenshot. These are created by
the service in the "dom_renderer" folder, so named because webpages are the most
common content to add. Everything else -- from the Flowgram website to the
recorder and player -- is handled by the Django project in the "django" folder.

Beyond that, I haven't run the code in almost three years, so you're on your
own. If I get more information I'll add it here.
